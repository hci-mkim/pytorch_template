# pytorch_template
this repo is pytorch template using colab 

original repo : https://github.com/FrancescoSaverioZuppichini/PyTorch-Deep-Learning-Template 

I made new code to run the original code easier and enable to run on colab environment.

User should download run.ipynb and upload to Google Drive and open.
